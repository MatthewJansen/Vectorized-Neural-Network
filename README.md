# Fully-connected-neural-network
Python implementation for a fully connected, vectorized neural network which I wrote for the purpose of displaying and challenging my understanding of neural networks.

- Recommended python version: Python 3.8.10 64-bit 

Neural networks computational graph structure which consists of layers of nodes called ’neurons’ which have biases and connecting weighted edges called ’synapses’.
The process of training a neural network consists of three steps:
  1. Forward Propagation:
  Here the inputs are fed to the network in order to obtain an output similar to the expected output from the dataset.
  2. Backpropagation:
  This step covers the process through which the relevance of each neuron’s activation values is computed with respect to the cost of the neural network’s output.
  3. Update Network:
  Finally, based on the results from backpropagating the output, the new weights and biases of the neural network are computed and updated.
  
(See documented discussion for a detailed description of the above list steps in this repo named 'Simple, Fully Connected, Vectorized Neural Network.pdf')
